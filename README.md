# PeaceOfCrop

A simple webserver that allows you to POST an image and recieve a Base64 result of a cropped image. Cropping is performed by starting in the center of your image and seeking black borders. I use this with a shortcut on my iphone that sends the image, decodes the base64, then saves the result.
